# Feedback on Eversight Hiring Process

Dear Mitchell,

Thank you for the opportunity to interview for the role at Eversight. I wanted to provide detailed feedback on my experience, as there are several areas where the process could be improved.

---

### **Pre-Screen CodeSignal Assessment**

**Pros:**
- The test effectively evaluated classical ML pipeline development, including Python skills for data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, overfitting prevention, and model caching.

**Cons:**
- The preparation instructions were misleading. The practice CodeSignal question on filesystem traversal had no relevance to the actual assessment.
- There was no indication that the test would emphasize the scikit-learn API. My familiarity with the library was fortunate, but luck should not be a primary factor in candidate screening.
- The CodeSignal platform was ambiguous and unintuitive. Requiring candidates to generate a `.pickle` file in a virtual terminal and then switch between scripts was unnecessarily convoluted and disconnected from real-world ML workflows.
- These platform-specific details do not reflect a candidate‚Äôs true ability to solve ML problems in their preferred development environment.

### **Second-Round Interview with Jacob**

**Pros:**
- Jacob displayed technical competence and professionalism.
- He provided helpful hints when I appeared nervous or needed assistance.

**Cons:**
- Jacob's demeanor felt adversarial, as though the interview‚Äôs sole purpose was to make me prove my worth. There was no effort to sell Eversight or explain why I might want to work there.
- The preparation instructions were inadequate. I was told there would be no coding, yet faced a surprise LeetCode-style question. The abrupt shift from high-level data science concepts to linear algebra and coding was jarring and unfair.
- The expectations conveyed were for elite-level performance, yet the compensation offered does not reflect this rigor. For such demands, a total compensation package of at least $300K would be appropriate.
- Jacob's approach to linear algebra questions came across as condescending, particularly when he struggled to articulate concepts like the *adjoint* of a matrix yet expected me to provide immediate precision on terms like "full-rank matrix" without prior indication that such knowledge would be assessed.
- The interview lacked any effort to connect personally or understand my background. There was no explanation of Eversight‚Äôs mission, team goals, or why this role matters. This lack of engagement made the experience feel cold and unwelcoming.

### **Overall Assessment**

The interview process highlighted several red flags üö©:

- **Unfair Expectations:** Candidates were tested on skills not listed in the job description, while critical role-related skills (e.g., experiment design, hypothesis testing, and communication with product teams) were ignored.
- **Inadequate Compensation:** The expectations exceed what the offered pay and benefits can justify. If elite performance is expected, compensation should reflect that.
- **Poor Candidate Experience:** The adversarial tone, surprise topics, and lack of interest in candidate backgrounds foster a negative experience. This approach may attract candidates who see the role as a temporary gig rather than an opportunity to contribute meaningfully.
- **Platform Issues:** The CodeSignal test format did not align with real-world ML workflows. A more effective alternative might be a platform like *Woven*.

Given my background‚Äîdegrees in Mathematics and Physics, fluency in Russian and Chinese, and experience developing and selling high-quality software‚ÄîI expect a hiring process that respects candidates‚Äô time, skills, and dignity. The current process falls short. In a small team like Eversight‚Äôs, a holistic evaluation of a candidate's intelligence and potential is essential. Assessing worthiness based on arbitrary aspects of linear algebra (e.g., "What is a Jordan form? What is Cramer's Rule?") misses the mark.

I hope this feedback helps refine your interview process to be more transparent, fair, and candidate-friendly. Additionally, it would be beneficial for Eversight to clarify whether the role is for a Python software engineer, a machine learning engineer, or a data scientist. A $150K salary may be reasonable for specialization in one of these areas, but not for all three.

Furthermore, the job description states that the candidate should ‚Äúbe a go-to resource for science-related questions about the product.‚Äù Expecting someone on a short-term contract of less than six months to be the authority on a product they are unfamiliar with is unrealistic.

The ultimate irony is that while Eversight claims to use data and advanced modeling to help other companies ‚Äúearn more and waste less,‚Äù the current approach to filling this role appears inefficient and inadequate. This process is likely costing the company significantly in recruiter expenses and time spent interviewing.

I typically don‚Äôt provide feedback in these situations, but I respect your recruiting efforts and want to offer meaningful, no-nonsense advice if I can.

Sincerely,

Nick Cemenenkoff
