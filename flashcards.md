### Q: What is elasticity of demand?

**A:** Elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of a good or service changes in response to a change in its price. It is expressed as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. High elasticity indicates demand is sensitive to price changes, while low elasticity indicates demand is relatively insensitive. For example, the price of gasoline is relatively inelastic (in the short run).

---

### Q: What is price elasticity?

**A:** Price elasticity refers to the degree to which the quantity demanded or supplied of a good changes in response to a price change. It is quantified as Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):

$$ \text{PED} = \frac{\% \Delta \text{Quantity Demanded}}{\% \Delta \text{Price}} $$

Values:
- **Elastic (PED > 1):** Demand changes significantly with price changes.
- **Inelastic (PED < 1):** Demand changes minimally with price changes.
- **Unitary (PED = 1):** Proportional change in demand and price.

### Q: What are dynamic pricing algorithms?

**A:** Dynamic pricing algorithms are computational models used to adjust prices in real time based on various factors such as demand, supply, competition, and customer behavior. These algorithms aim to optimize revenue and maximize profit by dynamically setting prices according to changing market conditions.

---

### Q: What are the most common techniques used in dynamic pricing algorithms?

**A:** The most common techniques used in dynamic pricing algorithms include:

1. **Rule-Based Pricing:** Uses predefined rules (e.g., if demand increases, raise the price).
2. **Time-Based Pricing:** Prices change based on time windows (e.g., airline tickets).
3. **Demand-Based Pricing:** Adjusts prices in response to real-time demand changes.
4. **Competitive Pricing:** Prices are dynamically adjusted based on competitors’ pricing.
5. **Machine Learning Models:** Algorithms learn from historical data to predict optimal prices.
6. **Inventory-Based Pricing:** Prices depend on stock levels (e.g., lower inventory raises prices).
7. **Segmentation-Based Pricing:** Different prices for different customer segments.

---

### Q: What are common techniques for measuring consumer preferences?

**A:** Common techniques for measuring consumer preferences include:

1. **Surveys and Questionnaires:** Directly ask consumers about their preferences.
2. **Conjoint Analysis:** Measures trade-offs consumers make between different product features.

6. **Purchase Data Analysis:** Examines historical purchase behavior to understand preferences.
7. **Eye-Tracking Studies:** Measure where consumers focus their attention.

---

### Q: What is conjoint analysis?

**A:** Conjoint analysis is a statistical technique used to determine how consumers value different features of a product or service. By presenting consumers with different combinations of features and asking them to choose their preferred option, conjoint analysis helps identify the trade-offs they are willing to make. This technique is commonly used in product design, pricing strategies, and market research.

### Q: What are common methods in time series forecasting?

**A:** Common methods in time series forecasting include:

1. **Naive Forecasting:** Uses the most recent observation as the forecast for future periods.
2. **Moving Averages (MA):** Averages the last *n* observations to smooth fluctuations.
3. **Exponential Smoothing (ETS):** Gives more weight to recent observations using a smoothing parameter.
4. **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA):** Combines autoregression, differencing, and moving averages to model time series data.

10. **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity):** Models volatility in financial time series.

---

### Q: What is SARIMAX modeling?

**A:** SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) is an extension of SARIMA that incorporates external predictors (exogenous variables). It models time series data by considering:

- **Seasonality:** Accounts for recurring patterns (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
- **Autoregression (AR):** Uses past values to predict future values.
- **Differencing (I):** Removes trends by subtracting prior observations.
- **Moving Average (MA):** Accounts for past forecast errors.
- **Exogenous Variables (X):** External factors that influence the time series.

SARIMAX is useful when external factors (e.g., promotions, holidays) impact the target variable.

---

**A:** Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook designed for handling time series data with daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality. It works well with missing data, outliers, and changing trends. Key features include:

- **Additive Model:** Combines trend, seasonality, and holiday effects.
- **Automatic Seasonality Detection:** Handles multiple seasonalities.
- **Flexible Trend Adjustment:** Allows for trend changes or "changepoints."
- **User-Friendly:** Minimal tuning required for accurate forecasts.

Prophet is particularly suited for business applications and data with strong seasonal patterns.

---

### Q: What is behavioral pricing?

**A:** Behavioral pricing is a strategy that incorporates insights from psychology and behavioral economics to understand how consumers perceive prices and make purchasing decisions. It leverages cognitive biases, heuristics, and emotional responses to influence consumer behavior. Techniques in behavioral pricing include:

- **Charm Pricing:** Setting prices just below round numbers (e.g., $9.99 instead of $10.00).
- **Bundling:** Offering products together to influence perceived value.
- **Decoy Pricing:** Presenting a less attractive option to make another option seem more appealing.
- **Framing:** Presenting prices in a way that emphasizes gains or discounts.

---

### Q: What is reference pricing?

**A:** Reference pricing is the strategy of setting a price based on consumers’ expectations or perceptions of what a fair price should be. These expectations are influenced by:

- **Past Prices:** Previous prices of the same product.
- **Competitor Prices:** Prices of similar products in the market.
- **Suggested Retail Prices:** Manufacturer’s recommended price.
- **Internal Benchmarks:** Consumers’ personal valuation of the product.

Reference pricing is often used to highlight discounts or make products appear more affordable by comparing them to a higher “reference” price.

---

### Q: What is anchoring?

**A:** Anchoring is a cognitive bias where individuals rely heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions. In pricing, the initial price shown to consumers influences their perception of subsequent prices. Examples of anchoring include:

- **Original vs. Discounted Prices:** Showing a high original price to make a discount seem more attractive (e.g., “Was $200, Now $150”).
- **High Initial Offers:** Starting with a high price to make later price reductions seem reasonable.
- **Price Comparisons:** Displaying premium options alongside standard options to make the standard option appear more affordable.

Anchoring helps shape consumers' willingness to pay based on the initial price they encounter.

---

### Q: What is econometric modeling?

**A:** Econometric modeling uses statistical techniques to quantify and analyze economic relationships based on empirical data. These models help test hypotheses, forecast trends, and understand causal relationships. Key components of econometric modeling include:

- **Data Collection:** Gathering economic or business data.
- **Model Specification:** Defining the mathematical relationship between variables.
- **Estimation:** Using methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate parameters.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Evaluating the significance of relationships.
- **Forecasting:** Predicting future outcomes based on model findings.

Examples of econometric models include **linear regression, time series models (ARIMA), and panel data models**.

---

### Q: What are generalized linear models?

**A:** Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are an extension of linear regression models that allow for response variables with different types of distributions (not just normal). GLMs consist of three main components:

1. **Random Component:** The distribution of the response variable (e.g., normal, binomial, Poisson).
2. **Systematic Component:** A linear combination of predictor variables.
3. **Link Function:** A function that links the linear predictor to the mean of the response variable (e.g., logit, log, identity).

**Common types of GLMs:**
- **Linear Regression:** For continuous outcomes (normal distribution).
- **Logistic Regression:** For binary outcomes (binomial distribution).
- **Poisson Regression:** For count data (Poisson distribution).

---

### Q: What is logistic regression?

**A:** Logistic regression is a type of Generalized Linear Model (GLM) used for predicting binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). Instead of fitting a straight line, logistic regression models the probability of an event occurring using the **logit function**:

$$
\text{logit}(p) = \ln\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n
$$

Where:
- $p$ is the probability of the positive outcome.
- $\beta$ values are the coefficients estimated during training.

**Key Features:**
- **Output:** Probabilities between 0 and 1.
- **Decision Boundary:** Often used with a threshold (e.g., $p > 0.5$).
- **Applications:** Classification problems such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and customer churn prediction.

---

### Q: What is Poisson regression?

**A:** Poisson regression is a type of Generalized Linear Model (GLM) used for modeling count data, where the response variable represents the number of times an event occurs. It assumes that the response variable follows a **Poisson distribution** and is typically used when the data are non-negative integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...). The model uses a **log link function** to relate the linear predictor to the mean of the response variable:

$$
\log(\lambda) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n
$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ is the expected count (mean) of the response variable.
- $\beta$ values are the coefficients estimated during training.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Suitable for **count data** (e.g., number of customer purchases, number of website clicks).
- Assumes the **mean and variance are equal** (a property of the Poisson distribution).
- Can be extended to **Negative Binomial Regression** if the variance exceeds the mean (overdispersion).

**Applications:**
- Predicting the number of calls to a call center.
- Modeling the number of accidents at a traffic intersection.
- Analyzing the frequency of disease occurrences in epidemiology.

---

### Q: What is causal inference?

**A:** Causal inference is the process of determining whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between variables. Unlike correlation, which only identifies associations, causal inference aims to understand how changes in one variable (the **treatment**) impact another variable (the **outcome**). This process often involves controlling for confounding factors and using statistical methods to isolate the causal effect.

Causal inference is essential in fields like economics, healthcare, and social sciences for making policy decisions and evaluating interventions.

---

### Q: What are the most common causal inference techniques?

**A:** The most common causal inference techniques include:

1. **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs):** Participants are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups to eliminate bias.
2. **Difference-in-Differences (DiD):** Compares the changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group.
3. **Instrumental Variables (IV):** Uses an external variable (instrument) to address endogeneity and estimate causal effects.
4. **Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD):** Exploits a cutoff or threshold to identify causal effects.
5. **Propensity Score Matching (PSM):** Matches treatment and control units with similar characteristics to control for confounding.
6. **Matching Methods:** Pairing units with similar covariates to isolate the treatment effect.

These methods help address biases and confounding factors to estimate causal relationships accurately.

---

### Q: What is difference-in-differences (DiD)?

**A:** **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** is a causal inference technique used to estimate the effect of a treatment or intervention by comparing the changes in outcomes between a treatment group and a control group over time. DiD assumes that both groups would follow a **parallel trend** in the absence of the treatment.

**Steps:**
1. Measure the outcome for both groups before and after the intervention.
2. Calculate the difference in outcomes over time for each group.
3. Subtract the difference in the control group from the difference in the treatment group to estimate the treatment effect.

**Example:** Evaluating the impact of a new law on employment by comparing employment rates before and after the law in a state that adopted it versus a state that did not.

---

### Q: What are instrumental variables (IV)?

**A:** **Instrumental Variables (IV)** is a method used in causal inference to address **endogeneity**—when an independent variable is correlated with the error term, leading to biased estimates. An instrumental variable helps isolate the causal effect by providing a source of variation that is correlated with the treatment but not with the error term.

**Conditions for a Valid Instrument:**
1. **Relevance:** The instrument is correlated with the treatment.
2. **Exogeneity:** The instrument is not correlated with the error term.

**Example:** Using the distance to the nearest college as an instrument to study the causal effect of education on earnings, assuming distance affects education levels but not earnings directly.

---

### Q: What is propensity score matching (PSM)?

**A:** **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)** is a technique used to estimate causal effects by matching treated and control units with similar characteristics (covariates). The propensity score is the probability of receiving the treatment, given observed characteristics.

**Steps:**
1. Estimate the propensity score using a logistic regression model.
2. Match each treated unit with one or more control units with similar propensity scores.
3. Compare outcomes between matched pairs to estimate the treatment effect.

**Advantages:**
- Reduces bias from confounding variables.
- Mimics the conditions of a randomized experiment.

**Applications:** Evaluating the effect of a new marketing campaign by matching customers who received the campaign with those who did not but have similar demographics.

---

### Q: What is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)?

**A:** **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** is a statistical method for estimating the parameters of a model by maximizing the likelihood function. The likelihood function measures how well the model explains the observed data for different parameter values. MLE finds the parameter estimates that make the observed data **most probable** under the assumed model.

For a given set of data points \(X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}\) and a parameter \( \theta \), MLE finds:

\[
\hat{\theta} = \arg\max_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta | X)
\]

Where \(\mathcal{L}(\theta | X)\) is the likelihood function.

---

### Q: What is the theory behind MLE?

**A:** The theory behind MLE is grounded in the principle of **likelihood**. Given a statistical model and observed data, the likelihood function represents the probability of observing the data for different parameter values. MLE selects the parameters that **maximize this likelihood**.

Key theoretical properties of MLE:

1. **Consistency:** As the sample size increases, the MLE converges to the true parameter value.
2. **Asymptotic Normality:** For large samples, the distribution of the MLE is approximately normal.
3. **Efficiency:** MLE achieves the lowest possible variance (the Cramér-Rao lower bound) among unbiased estimators for large samples.

The goal of MLE is to find the parameters that best explain the data by maximizing the likelihood of the observed outcomes.

---

### Q: How is MLE implemented?

**A:** MLE is implemented using the following steps:

1. **Define the Likelihood Function:**
   Based on the assumed probability distribution of the data, define the likelihood function \( \mathcal{L}(\theta | X) \). For independent observations, the likelihood is the product of individual probabilities:

   \[
   \mathcal{L}(\theta | X) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i; \theta)
   \]

2. **Log-Likelihood Transformation:**
   To simplify the computation, take the natural log of the likelihood function (log-likelihood):

   \[
   \log \mathcal{L}(\theta | X) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log f(x_i; \theta)
   \]

3. **Maximize the Log-Likelihood:**
   Find the parameter \( \theta \) that maximizes the log-likelihood using calculus. This involves solving:

   \[
   \frac{d}{d\theta} \log \mathcal{L}(\theta | X) = 0
   \]

4. **Numerical Optimization:**
   For complex models, use numerical methods like **Gradient Descent**, **Newton-Raphson**, or **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** to find the maximum.

**Example in Python:**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Example: Estimating the mean of a normal distribution
def negative_log_likelihood(theta, data):
    mu, sigma = theta[0], theta[1]
    return -np.sum(np.log(1 / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * sigma) * np.exp(-0.5 * ((data - mu) / sigma)**2)))

data = np.array([2.3, 2.7, 3.1, 2.8, 3.0])
initial_guess = [0, 1]
result = minimize(negative_log_likelihood, initial_guess, args=(data,))
print("MLE estimates:", result.x)
```

### Q: What is hypothesis testing?

**A:** **Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves evaluating whether there is enough evidence to reject a **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** in favor of an **alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)**.

**Steps in hypothesis testing:**

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The assumption that there is no effect or difference (e.g., “The new drug has no effect”).
   - **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: The claim being tested (e.g., “The new drug is effective”).

2. **Choose a Significance Level ($\alpha$)**: Commonly set at 0.05 (5%).

3. **Compute a Test Statistic**: Based on the sample data (e.g., z-score, t-score).

4. **Calculate the p-Value**: The probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true.

5. **Make a Decision**:
   - **Reject $H_0$** if $p \leq \alpha$.
   - **Fail to Reject $H_0$** if $p > \alpha$.

**Example:** Testing whether a new marketing strategy increases sales.

---

### Q: What is a p-value?

**A:** A **p-value** is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed value, assuming the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is true. It measures the strength of evidence against $H_0$.

**Interpretation:**
- **Small p-value ($p \leq \alpha$)**: Strong evidence against $H_0$; reject the null hypothesis.
- **Large p-value ($p > \alpha$)**: Insufficient evidence against $H_0$; fail to reject the null hypothesis.

**Example:**
A p-value of 0.03 means there is a 3% chance of observing the data if $H_0$ is true. If $\alpha = 0.05$, you would reject $H_0$.

---

### Q: What is a confidence interval?

**A:** A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (e.g., mean or proportion) with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).

**General Formula:**
$$
\text{CI} = \hat{\theta} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{\theta})
$$

Where:
- $\hat{\theta}$ = Sample estimate (e.g., sample mean).
- $z_{\alpha/2}$ = Critical value (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence).
- $\text{SE}(\hat{\theta})$ = Standard error of the estimate.

**Interpretation:**
A 95% confidence interval means that if the study were repeated many times, 95% of the intervals would contain the true parameter.

**Example:**
A 95% confidence interval for the average height might be (165 cm, 175 cm). This means you are 95% confident the true average height is between 165 cm and 175 cm.

---

### Q: What types of errors are there?

**A:** In hypothesis testing, there are two primary types of errors:

1. **Type I Error (False Positive):** Rejecting the null hypothesis ($H_0$) when it is actually true.
2. **Type II Error (False Negative):** Failing to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$) when it is actually false.

These errors are controlled by:

- **Significance Level ($\alpha$)**: Probability of a Type I error (commonly set at 0.05).
- **Power (1 - $\beta$)**: Probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ (related to Type II error).

---

### Q: What is a Type I error?

**A:** A **Type I error** occurs when the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is **incorrectly rejected**, even though it is actually true. It is also called a **false positive**.

- **Probability of Type I Error**: $\alpha$ (significance level), commonly set at 0.05.

**Example:**
A medical test concludes a patient has a disease (positive result) when they do not actually have it.

---

### Q: What is a Type II error?

**A:** A **Type II error** occurs when the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is **incorrectly accepted** (i.e., failing to reject it), even though it is actually false. It is also called a **false negative**.

- **Probability of Type II Error**: $\beta$.
- **Power**: $1 - \beta$, the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$.

**Example:**
A medical test concludes a patient does not have a disease (negative result) when they actually do have it.

---

### Summary of Errors

| **Decision**                 | **$H_0$ True**          | **$H_0$ False**         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Reject $H_0$**           | Type I Error (False +)    | Correct Decision          |
| **Fail to Reject $H_0$**   | Correct Decision          | Type II Error (False -)   |

---

### Q: What are Bayesian methods?

**A:** **Bayesian methods** are statistical techniques based on **Bayes' Theorem**, which provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence or data becomes available. Bayesian methods incorporate prior beliefs and observed data to produce a **posterior distribution**.

**Bayes’ Theorem Formula:**

$$
P(\theta | X) = \frac{P(X | \theta) P(\theta)}{P(X)}
$$

Where:
- $P(\theta)$ Prior probability (belief before seeing the data).
- $P(X | \theta)$ Likelihood of the data given the parameter $\theta\).
- $P(X)$ Marginal likelihood (normalizing constant).
- $P(\theta | X)$ Posterior probability (updated belief).

**Applications:**
- Spam detection, medical diagnosis, risk assessment, machine learning.

---

### Q: What is Bayesian regression?

**A:** **Bayesian regression** is a regression technique that uses Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of the model. Unlike traditional regression, Bayesian regression produces a **distribution of parameter estimates** (posterior distributions) instead of point estimates.

**Steps in Bayesian Regression:**

1. **Define a Prior Distribution** for the model parameters (e.g., normal distribution).
2. **Specify the Likelihood** based on the observed data.
3. **Compute the Posterior Distribution** using Bayes' Theorem.
4. **Draw Inferences** from the posterior (e.g., mean, credible intervals).

**Advantages:**
- Incorporates prior knowledge.
- Provides uncertainty estimates for parameters.
- Robust to small sample sizes.

**Example:** Predicting housing prices with uncertainty estimates for each coefficient.

---

### Q: What is hierarchical modeling?

**A:** **Hierarchical modeling** (also called **multilevel modeling**) is a statistical approach where data are structured in multiple levels or groups. It allows for the modeling of both **group-level** and **individual-level** effects simultaneously.

In hierarchical models:

- Parameters can vary **within groups** (e.g., individual schools) and **across groups** (e.g., school districts).
- Each group has its own parameters, but these parameters are drawn from a **higher-level distribution**.

**Example:**
Analyzing student test scores where students are nested within classrooms, and classrooms are nested within schools.

**Benefits of Hierarchical Modeling:**
- Accounts for variability at multiple levels.
- Improves estimates by borrowing strength across groups.
- Reduces bias in parameter estimates for grouped data.

---

### Q: What is Design of Experiments (DOE)?

**A:** **Design of Experiments (DOE)** is a systematic approach to planning, conducting, and analyzing controlled experiments to understand the effects of multiple factors on a response variable. DOE helps identify relationships between inputs (factors) and outputs (responses) and optimize processes or products.

**Key Goals of DOE:**
- Determine which factors influence the outcome.
- Optimize performance by adjusting factor levels.
- Minimize variability and improve quality.

**Applications:**
- Manufacturing process optimization, product design, clinical trials, and marketing experiments.

---

### Q: What are the core principles of DOE?

**A:** The core principles of Design of Experiments (DOE) include:

1. **Replication:**
   - Repeating the experiment to estimate variability and improve accuracy.

2. **Randomization:**
   - Randomly assigning treatments to reduce bias and ensure the results are generalizable.

3. **Blocking:**
   - Grouping similar experimental units to control for known sources of variability.

4. **Factorial Design:**
   - Studying multiple factors simultaneously by testing all possible combinations of factor levels.

5. **Control:**
   - Using a control group or baseline condition for comparison with experimental conditions.

These principles help ensure experiments are rigorous, unbiased, and statistically valid.

---

### Q: What is A/B Testing?

**A:** **A/B testing** is a type of controlled experiment used to compare two versions (A and B) of a product, webpage, or feature to determine which one performs better. It is widely used in digital marketing, product design, and software development.

**Steps in A/B Testing:**

1. **Define the Goal:** Identify the key metric (e.g., conversion rate).
2. **Split the Audience:** Randomly assign users to **Group A** (control) and **Group B** (variant).
3. **Implement the Test:** Expose Group A to the original version and Group B to the modified version.
4. **Measure Outcomes:** Collect data for the key metric.
5. **Analyze Results:** Use statistical methods (e.g., hypothesis testing) to determine if the difference is significant.

**Example:**
Testing two versions of a website landing page to see which one leads to more sign-ups.

---

### Q: What are multi-armed bandits?

**A:** **Multi-armed bandits** are a type of sequential decision-making problem where an agent must choose between multiple options (called "arms") to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Each arm provides a random reward drawn from an unknown probability distribution. The term comes from the analogy of a gambler choosing between slot machines (bandits) in a casino.

**Goal:** Balance between exploring different arms to learn their rewards and exploiting the arm that appears to give the highest reward.

**Applications:**
- Online ad placement (choosing which ad to display).
- Clinical trials (choosing treatments).
- Dynamic pricing (optimizing price offers).

---

### Q: Explain the exploration-exploitation tradeoff for adaptive environments.

**A:** The **exploration-exploitation tradeoff** describes the balance between two strategies in decision-making for adaptive environments:

1. **Exploration:**
   - Trying new options to gain more information about their potential rewards.
   - Example: Testing new ads to discover their click-through rates.

2. **Exploitation:**
   - Choosing the best-known option to maximize immediate reward.
   - Example: Displaying the ad with the highest click-through rate so far.

**The Challenge:**
- **Too much exploration:** You may miss out on maximizing rewards by not taking advantage of known good options.
- **Too much exploitation:** You may fail to discover potentially better options.

**Example:**
In a **multi-armed bandit problem**, a gambler must decide how often to try different slot machines (exploration) versus playing the one that has given the highest payout so far (exploitation).

**Common Strategies to Balance Exploration and Exploitation:**
- **Epsilon-Greedy:** Explore randomly with probability \(\epsilon\), exploit otherwise.
- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Select the option with the highest upper confidence bound on expected reward.
- **Thompson Sampling:** Use Bayesian inference to sample actions based on their probability of being optimal.

---

### Q: What are A/B testing metrics?

**A:** **A/B testing metrics** are quantitative measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of variations in an A/B test. Common metrics include:

1. **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase, sign-up).
2. **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** The percentage of users who click on a link or button.
3. **Bounce Rate:** The percentage of users who leave a page without further interaction.
4. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):** The average income generated per user.
5. **Engagement Metrics:** Time spent on site, pages viewed, etc.
6. **Retention Rate:** The percentage of users who return after their first visit.
7. **Lift:** The relative improvement between the control and the variant.

---

### Q: What is statistical power?

**A:** **Statistical power** is the probability that a hypothesis test correctly rejects the null hypothesis ($H_0$) when the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) is true. In other words, it measures the likelihood of detecting an actual effect.

$$
\text{Power} = 1 - \beta
$$

Where $\beta$ is the probability of a Type II error (false negative).

**Factors Affecting Power:**
- **Sample Size:** Larger samples increase power.
- **Effect Size:** Larger effects are easier to detect.
- **Significance Level ($\alpha$)**: Higher $\alpha$ increases power.
- **Variability:** Lower variability increases power.

A power of **0.8 (80%)** is commonly used, meaning there is an 80% chance of detecting a true effect.

---

### Q: What are tree-based machine learning methods?

**A:** **Tree-based machine learning methods** use decision trees as their core structure to make predictions. Common methods include:

1. **Decision Trees:** Simple models that split data based on feature values.
2. **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees trained on random subsets of data and features.
3. **Gradient Boosting:** Sequentially builds trees to correct errors made by previous trees (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
4. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation):** Combines multiple decision trees to reduce variance.
5. **Extra Trees (Extremely Randomized Trees):** Similar to random forests but with randomized splits.
6. **Classification and Regression Trees (CART):** Used for both classification and regression tasks.

**Advantages:**
- Handle non-linear relationships.
- Perform well on structured/tabular data.
- Robust to outliers and missing data.

---

---

### Q: What are gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT)?

**A:** **Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)** are an ensemble learning method that builds a series of decision trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects errors made by the previous trees. It minimizes a loss function using **gradient descent** to improve performance iteratively.

**Key Features:**
- Trees are added one at a time.
- Each new tree focuses on reducing the residuals (errors) of previous trees.
- Effective for both classification and regression tasks.

**Advantages:**
- High predictive accuracy.
- Handles non-linear relationships well.

**Common Libraries:**
- **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **CatBoost**.

### Q: Explain L1/L2 regularization.

**A:** **L1 and L2 regularization** are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty to the loss function based on the model's coefficients.

- **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Adds the **absolute values** of the coefficients as a penalty term:

- **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Adds the **squared values** of the coefficients as a penalty term:
  $$\text{Loss} = \text{Original Loss} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2$$
  - Encourages smaller coefficients but does not set them to zero.

- **Elastic Net:** Combines both L1 and L2 regularization:
