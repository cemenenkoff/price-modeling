# [The Good-Better-Best Approach to Pricing](https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-good-better-best-approach-to-pricing)

## TL:DR
- Focusing more on running discounts to attract price-sensitive customers rather than giving high-end customers reasons to spend more can be suboptimal.
- A multi-tiered offering can better appeal to a larger customer base.
  - "Good" is the base model to attract *new* customers
  - "Better" is an upgrade to *keep* current customers happy
  - "Best" is the latest model for *elite* customers
- This approach is nothing new, but devising, testing, and launching the strategy is nontrivial.
- Key steps include
  - identifying "fence" attributes that prevent current customers from trading down
  - choosing features and names to create clear differentiation and value
  - setting prices using feedback from experts
  - drawing on conjoint analysis and market research

- Customers are highly price-sensitive, and most will buy the least-expensive option is a common assumption.
- The GBB pricing model challenges this assumption.
- These days, GBB is found in many places.
- Gas stations sell regular, plus, and super fuel.
- Implementation is nontrivial, and poor deployment of a GBB model can lose money from customers trading down.

## The 3 Approaches of GBB
- Offensive plays aimed at generating new business
- Defensive plays meant to counter competitors
- Behavioral plays drawing on consumer psychology

### Offensive GBB
- Margins can be lifted with high-end Best versions.
- The floor can be lowered with Good offerings.
  - It makes a product more accessible to more consumers.
  - It can limit the need for sales and discounts.
  - Frequent sales erode long-term pricing power.

### Defensive GBB
- Common responses to a cheaper rival is to
  - Cut prices in response
  - Launch a "fighter brand" discounted product with new branding
- Many times, creating a new Good product is a better defensive strategy.
- Sometimes customers use a new competitor as leverage to ask for a discount, but if you offer them a Good alternative by *your* company, it eliminates their leverage and calls their bluff.

### Consumer Psychology
- Packing a product full of a myriad of features can confuse and overwhelm customers.
- A GBB model helps potential buyers focus on the features they value most.
- GBB can shift from a buy or don't-buy mindset to an incremental consideration of value and spending.
- Customers like choices rather than an ultimatum. Feeling a sense of agency helps them feel at ease.
- When faced with multiple options, customers tend to decide more quickly *whether to buy*, and use the majority of their time to focus on *what to buy*.
  - This mental shift treats the Good version as a sunk cost.
  - The logic is that since the Good is a given, the next logical question is considering the upgraded Better.
- People exhibit a Goldilocks effect, where they tend to choose the middle option as a "compromise".
- Pragmatically, GBB is usually compelling to senior execs, so instituting it is easier.
- Execs get behind ideas they find the easiest to understand.

## Brainstorming Tiers and Features
### How many product versions to offer?
- Three is most common.
- Sometimes, Better and Best is more doable.
- More choices is risky -- when consumers have too many options, they become confused or paralyzed with indecision.
  - This is known as "The Paradox of Choice"
### How many features to include in each tier?
- Many features are unintuitive.
- Features can be added, dropped, and combined in different ways to create different *perceptions* of value.
#### Does the feature have mass appeal or low appeal?
#### How would adding or removing it affect the offering?
#### Is it a fence attribute?
- A "fence" attribute is one that is so important, it creates a *barrier* preventing existing customers from crossing over to the cheaper version.
- Identifying fence attributes is critical!
### What is the goal of the Good offering?
- Pick up new customers *without* losing existing ones.
- Loss of fence attributes should make downgrading feel like a difficult and unpleasant choice.

## Defining and Pricing Bundles
- Fence attributes should have both *wide* and *deep* appeal and are somewhat costly to produce.
- Sometimes high-appeal and low-cost Best features are less about the product and more about the customer experience.
  - A quicker delivery time can be part of the Best experience.
  - Warranties are also included here.
- Although it may be tempting to throw every great feature into the Best model, doing so may make the product unrealistically expensive.
- Generally, no more than four attributes should differ between Good and Better and Better and Best.
- It's important to maintain a consistent progression of benefits from Good to Better to Best.
- A good rule of thumb for pricing is that Good shouldn't be more than 25% below Better, and Best should not exceed 50% more than Better.
- *Product claims, imagery, and lifestyle imagery* are key when presenting the bundles.

## Conjoin Analysis
- This technique involves giving subjects a series of binary product choices, each with difference features and prices, and asking which they prefer.
